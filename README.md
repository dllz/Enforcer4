#Group Butler

##Introduction

This bot has been created to help people in the administration of a group, with a lot of useful tools.

This bot born as an [Otouto](https://github.com/topkecleon/otouto) [v3.1](https://github.com/topkecleon/otouto/tree/26c1299374af130bbf8457af904cb4ea450caa51) ([@mokubot](https://telegram.me/mokubot)), but has been turned in an administration bot.

##In few words
Group Butler is a Telegram API bot written in Lua. It has been created to help the members of a group to keep it clean and regulated, from the point of view of administrators and normal users.

This bot takes its long-polling loop and its structure from Otouto 3.1 and it's plugin-based. This makes easier to manage each function and command of the bot, and allows to split the different capabilities of it in different files for a more specific vision of what it should do.

Follow the [channel](https://telegram.me/groupbutler_ch) if you want to be updated about new changes. The official bot is [@GroupButler_bot](http://github.com/groupbutler_bot).

##Setup
You **must** have Lua (5.2+) installed, plus some modules: LuaSocket, LuaSec, Redis-Lua, Lua term and Lua serpent. And, to upload files, you need Curl installed too.

How to install LuaRocks and set-up the modules:

```bash
# Download and install LuaSocket, LuaSec, Redis-Lua, Lua-term and serpent

$ wget http://luarocks.org/releases/luarocks-2.2.2.tar.gz
$ tar zxpf luarocks-2.2.2.tar.gz
$ cd luarocks-2.2.2
$ ./configure; sudo make bootstrap
$ sudo luarocks install luasocket
$ sudo luarocks install luasec
$ sudo luarocks install redis-lua
$ sudo luarocks install lua-term
$ sudo luarocks install serpent
$ cd ..
```

Install Curl, only if missing:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install curl
```

Clone the github repository:
```bash
# Clone the repo and give the permissions to start the launch script

$ git clone https://github.com/RememberTheAir/GroupButler.git
$ cd GroupButler && sudo chmod 777 launch.sh
```

**First of all, take a look to your bot settings:**

> • Make sure that privacy is disabled (more info in the [official Bots FAQ page](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#what-messages-will-my-bot-get)). Write `/setprivacy` to [BotFather](http://telegram.me/BotFather) to check the current setting.

**Before you do anything, open config.lua in a text editor and make the following changes:**

> • Set bot_api_key to the authentication token you received from the [BotFather](http://telegram.me/BotFather).
>
> • Set admin as your Telegram ID (under `admin.owner` field and under `admin.admins`, as a table element with `true` value).
>
> • You can set up a log group where error messages will be sent: this allows to split errors from user feedbacks. Replace the current id with the id of your designed group, otherwise remove the line.
>
> • Set your bot channel (if you have one) in config.lua, under `channel` field. You should add the bot to the channel admins, if you want to post something through it.
>
> • If it asks for the sudo password during/after the installation, insert it.

Before start the bot, you have to start Redis. Open a new window and type:
```bash
# Start Redis

$ sudo service redis-server start
```

If you are updating the bot, always check near the `version` field if you have to run `/aupdate` command after the first start.

##MUST READ!!!

Before stop the bot, if you don't want to loose your redis datas, you have to perform a save.

There are three ways to do this: use `/astop` command to stop the bot (datas will be saved automatically), use `/asave` command to save datas (and then stop the bot), or open a terminal window and run `redis-cli bgsave` or `redis-cli save` (and then stop the bot).

Please remember to do one of this easy things in order to avoid to loose important informations.

You may want to perform a save each minute, for this you need to change the boolean value of the `cron` function in `plugins/admin.lua` from `false` to `cron` (or the name of the cron function).

In this way, a cron job will run every minute and will perform a redis background save.

* * *

##Start the process

To start the bot, run `./launch.sh`. To stop the bot, press Ctrl+c twice.

You may also start the bot with `lua bot.lua`, but then it will not restart automatically.

* * *

Don't worry if in your log chat/private chat with the bot you will find a lot of messages marked with the #BadRequest tag. Most of them are users fault, check `config.lua` and your log for more info about the api responses.

* * *

Note that this bot is not opensource because everyone can be able to clone it and run its own copy. It's opensource because everyone can take a look on how the bot works, and see which data are stored. There are some installation intructions just because why not.

Moreover, I like to change redis keys where settings are stored often. So, please, if you are going to update your bot unsing `git pull`, take care to use `/aupdate` command too if needed (take a look to the comment near the `version` field in `config.lua`).

* * *

Everyone who will try to reach me via Telegram will be instantly blocked. I'm sorry but I won't give any kind of tecnical support, bacause of four reasons: I'm a noob, I have few time, the bot is very easy to install and lua is a very friendly programming language.

There is a ton of great Telegram groups about bot developing, just find one and ask your question there. I could be a member and reply to you, or more probably someone who knows the answer better than me will reply.

At this point, trying to contact me = haven't read the whole readme, and this is a valid motivation to ignore the message.

##Syncing the ban database

If you are running a clone of this bot, you may want to import the ban stats (the kick/ban counts of each known user) of [@GroupButler_bot](http://github.com/groupbutler_bot) in your database.

You can use `/exportban` command (only in the private chat with the bot) to receive a serialized json file with all the actual bot database. Reply to the file with `/importban` to add the info contained in the file in your database.

**Note**: if you already have an entry of an user, this will be overwritten with the actual bot counters. The other entries will stay untouched. If you want to sum the imported counters to your current counters, there is some commented code in `plugins/users.lua` for this. But remember that future imports won't care of the already imported datas, this means your database will have the previously imported counters X2.
